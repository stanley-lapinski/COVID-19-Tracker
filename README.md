# COVID-19-Tracker


**What does this application do?**

This is a web application designed to track all new cases of Corona virus across the world with emphesis on certain countries like China, USA, Italy or Spain. Information about new cases changes every day for every country. Data based on which this application is build, is provided by another GitHub user (profile addres below). I would like to point out that this application was build for personal purposes and should not be used as a reference in any media outlets. This project was build for educational and job-hunting purposes hence the source of specific information was not thoroughly checked. Information about specific cases in specific country may differ from other sources and as an author of this application I do not hold myself responsible for misinformation.
